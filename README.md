# Salary Prediction App
- This is a web application that predicts the salary based on years of experience using a Simple Linear Regression model. The app is built using Python libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, and the frontend is created using the Streamlit framework.

# Features
- Salary Prediction: Enter the number of years of experience, and the app predicts the corresponding salary using a trained linear regression model.
- User-Friendly Interface: The app provides an intuitive interface to input data and visualize the output.
# Libraries and Frameworks Used
- Numpy: For numerical operations.
- Pandas: For data manipulation.
- Matplotlib: For data visualization (if needed in future versions).
- Scikit-learn (sklearn): For creating and training the machine learning model (Simple Linear Regression).
- Streamlit: For building the interactive web interface.


# How to Use
- Input the number of years of experience in the provided field.
- Click on Predict Salary.
- The app will display the predicted salary based on the input.


# Model
- Algorithm: Simple Linear Regression
- The model is trained on a dataset containing features related to years of experience and salary.

# For an experience of 3 years, the predicted salary is displayed in the format shown below:

The predicted salary of 3.0 is: $[54717.82453082].
